    "* Write a program as a .py file or Jupyter notebook that generates the Look-and-say sequence for\n",
    "10 steps starting from a given number.\n",
    "* The look-and-say sequence is defined as follows:\n",
    "    * Start with any positive integer.\n",
    "    * The next number in the sequence is generated by counting and describing consecutive digits\n",
    "of the current number.\n",
    "        * For example \"1\" is read as \"one 1\" and becomes \"11\".\n",
    "        * \"11\" is read as \"two 1s\" and becomes \"21\".\n",
    "        * \"21\" is read as \"one 2, then one 1\" and becomes \"1211\".\n",
    "        * \"1211\" is read as \"one 1, one 2, then two 1s\" and becomes \"111221\".\n",

    "    * Implement a function for computing the next number in the look-and-say sequence based on\n",

    "            * Iterate through the string, counting consecutive identical digits.\n",
    "            * When a different digit is encountered, append the count and digit to the result string.\n",
    "            * Continue until the entire string has been processed.\n",
    "            * Do not forget to process the last group of digits!\n",
